> DataClear Desktop is the ONLY solution that moves your PC, Browsing and Data out of the United States and out of prying (and spying) hands. Our solution automatically builds you a clean, on-demand, virus free, brand new virtual PC outside of the United States, and wipes it clean, destroying it completely when you log out. If you wish to store your data, the solution includes a custom triple level encryption system with multiple factor authentication. Browsers include the popular TOR, FireFox & Chrome. (Although we recommend TOR).
